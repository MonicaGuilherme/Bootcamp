# Hello and welcome!

This repository is a collection of projects I built during my Full-Stack Bootcamp.

Most of the work here is almost complete, though I plan to polish and improve a few of the projects over time. Now that the bootcamp is behind me, I'm focused on continuing my growth as a developer.

Feel free to browse the code, share your thoughts, or get in touch â€” feedback is always welcome!
