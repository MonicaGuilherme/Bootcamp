The folders here contain works still in progress that will be updated and improved over time. Currently, they include:

ConcurrentChatServer – Java-based code for a server that allows users to send and receive messages either individually or as a broadcast to all users.
A small "Paint"-like program where you can move across a grid, painting and erasing the color of the squares as desired.
A game – Foxsalypse – also developed in Java using the SimpleGraphics library. Inspired by the well-known Plants vs. Zombies, the game challenges players to protect a chicken coop from invading foxes by shooting plant spores to defeat them.
