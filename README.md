# Hello and welcome!

This portfolio showcases projects I developed during my Full-Stack Bootcamp training, along with various coding experiments and personal challenges Iâ€™ve taken on throughout my learning journey.

Inside this repository, you will find mostly ongoing projects and works that I will continue to update and improve over time. Now that the bootcamp is over, the real adventure begins in this exciting new field of knowledge.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, and reach out!
