## Description  
This project is a simple concurrent chat server written in Java that enables multiple users to connect and chat in real time. It was started as part of the bootcamp introduction to Java networking and concurrency concepts.

## Overview  
- **Multithreaded Server:** Supports multiple clients connecting simultaneously.  
- **Basic Broadcast:** Users can send messages that are broadcast to all connected clients.  
- **Work in Progress:** The broadcast feature is still being improved and is not yet fully functional.  
- **Future Features Planned:** Private messaging, user lists, graceful disconnects, and more.

## Current Status  
This project is in an early stage of development and serves as a learning exercise. Although the server can handle multiple clients, key functionalities such as proper message broadcasting, private messaging, and user management are still under development and will be improved in future updates.
