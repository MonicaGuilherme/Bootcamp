# Your Chiken House Needs Protection
# Description
Foxalypse is a tower defense-style game inspired by Plants vs. Zombies, where you protect your chicken house from invading foxes.

# Tech Stack
Java

SimpleGraphics (for basic 2D graphics)

# Current Features
Basic gameplay mechanics with plants defending against waves of foxes.

The player helps the plants by directing which one should shoot and defend the chicken house as more and more foxes spawn on the lawn.

The game speeds up over time, increasing the challenge.

Plants can evolve one at a time each time you earn 50 points, after reaching the 150 points threshold.

# Planned Improvements
Randomly spawning foxes to increase unpredictability and challenge.

Pop-up alerts for plant upgrades and game events.

Stronger foxes to raise the difficulty level.

Improved menus and gameplay interaction.

# Current Status
*In progress*

The game is currently functional, but the code requires cleaning and refactoring. The build process (via build.xml) is not yet working but will be implemented in the future.
