## 📜 Description
**Foxalypse** is a tower defense-style game inspired by *Plants vs. Zombies*, where you protect your chicken house from invading foxes.

This project was developed as a **group assignment** during our Full-Stack Bootcamp.  
We had **9 days and 10 nights**, with only **4 weeks of Java experience**, to bring the game to life.

## 🎮 Current Features
- Basic gameplay mechanics with plants defending against waves of foxes  
- Player helps the plants by selecting which one should shoot  
- Game difficulty increases as foxes spawn faster  
- Plants can evolve individually every 50 points, after reaching 150 points

## 🚧 Planned Improvements
Although the initial goal has been achieved, we may revisit this project in the future to explore new features such as:

- Randomized fox spawns for increased unpredictability  
- Pop-up alerts for upgrades and in-game events  
- Stronger fox types to increase difficulty  
- Improved menus and smoother user interaction

## ✅ Current Status
**Completed** – The game is fully functional and met the assignment objectives.  
The code still requires cleanup and refactoring. The `build.xml` build process is not yet implemented but may be added in the future.
