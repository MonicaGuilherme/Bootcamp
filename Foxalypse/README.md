A tower defense-style game inspired by Plants vs. Zombies, where you protect your chicken house from invading foxes. Tech Stack: Java, SimpleGraphics.

This game will be improved with randomly spawning foxes, pop-up alerts for plant upgrades, and stronger foxes to increase the challenge.
I also plan to enhance the graphics and make the game more engaging and interactive, from the menus to the gameplay.
