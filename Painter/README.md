A small "Paint"-like program where you can move across a grid, painting and erasing the color of the squares as desired.

This small program is still in its early stages. It currently features only a grid and a movable cursor, which can be controlled with the arrow keys and change color by pressing space.
Over time, new features will be added, such as painting grid squares, erasing painted squares, saving drawings, and restoring the last saved drawing after clearing the grid.
